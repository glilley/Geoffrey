			<p>Like millions of other sites you've likely visited, Huit.ly uses Google Analytics.</p>
			<h2>Ahh, What does Huit.ly track?</h2>
			<p>Huit.ly uses Google Analytics to collect <strong>anonymous</strong> information such as IP address, operating system, browser type, how long you stayed for, and how you got here, which is used to aid in marketing, site management, and product enhancements.

			<h2>How does Google Analytics track me?</h2>
			<p>Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitors interactions.

			Google collects all of this information anonymously.  Personal information is information that identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information.  Google Analytics prohibits the tracking or collecting of this information or associating personal information with web analytics information.</p>
